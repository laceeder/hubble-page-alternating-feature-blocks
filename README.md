## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to change the color of SVG images using the internal code and how to position certain elements in a specific location on the page.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working with the svg images as well as having elements of the website that need to be moved with the position properties.
